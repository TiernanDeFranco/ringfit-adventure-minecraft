# Minecraft with Motion Controls (Ring Fit Adventure Controller)
Originally coded 7/26/2020 at age 16, makes use of the Titan Two and GPC language to convert physical walking/jumping into in-game movements, and squeezing the ring-con to attack

In summer 2020, being a 16 year old I obviously was playing video games all day, and Minecraft is a classic but several months earlier one of my favorite games at the time came out: Ring Fit Adventure.

I said to myself: "What if I could play Minecraft with motion controls?- wait I'm a programmer! I can totally do that" I originally wanted to see if I could write a Python script to accomplish this, and while it may have been possible, I decided to purchase the Titan Two and learn some GPC code to program all the inputs and outputs from there.
